  <h1>Counting Pending Tasks</h1>

  <p>We want to know about just the events from a single mouse click
  while a bunch of other stuff is happening on the page</p>

  <p>This is useful in E2E testing. Because you know when there are
  no async tasks, you avoid adding timeouts that wait for tasks that
  run for an indeterminable amount of time.</p>
